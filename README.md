# Healthcare Data Breach
This is exploring the healthcare data breach [dataset](https://data.world/health/health-data-breaches) from 2009-2016 provided by the Department of Health and Human Services. I used Microsoft SQL Server to remove any null values, fill in null values, and remove any unnecessary rows and columns before developing a dashboard on Tableau. 

## Data Cleaning 

I need to change the column names in a more coherent format to make it easier when selecting them for analysis. On Microsoft SQL server there are 2 ways to do this. 

**Rename a column using Object Explorer**
1. In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of Database engine. 
2. In **Object Explorer**, right-click the table in which you want to rename columns and choose **Rename**.
3. Type a new column name.

**Rename a column using table designer**
1. In **Object Explorer**, right-click the table to which you want to rename columns and choose **Design**. 
2. Under **Column Name**, select the name you want to change and type a new one. 
3. On the **File** menu, select **Save** ***table name***.

I need to reformat breach_submission_date column to DATE format. 

``` sql 
ALTER TABLE dbo.ReportTable
ALTER COLUMN breach_submission_date DATE; 
```
Extract year from breach_submission_date column and create a new column. 

``` sql 
SELECT 
  DATEPART(year, breach_submission_date_year) AS year
 FROM dbo.ReportTable; 
 
ALTER TABLE dbo.ReportTable
 ADD year INT; 
 
UPDATE dbo.ReportTable
 SET year = DATEPART(year, breach_submission_date_year);
```
See if there's any duplicates and delete the duplicate 
 ``` sql 
DELETE * 
 FROM (
  SELECT *, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY name_of_covered_entity, state, covered_entity_type, 
    individuals_affected, breach_submission_date ORDER BY name_of_covered_entity) row_num 
    FROM dbo.ReportTable) a
 WHERE row_num > 1;
 ```
Check if there's any nulls on state column 
``` sql 
SELECT * 
FROM dbo.ReportTable
WHERE state IS NULL; 
```
It seems like the rows with no states are companies out of the US. We can delete those since this analysis is only focusing in US data. 
``` sql 
DELETE FROM dbo.ReportTable WHERE state IS NULL; 
```
Checking if there's any nulls on individuals_affected 
``` sql
SELECT * 
FROM dbo.ReportTable
WHERE individuals_affected IS NULL; 
``` 
Delete any null values for individuals_affected.
``` sql
DELETE FROM dbo.ReportTable WHERE individuals_affected IS NULL; 
```
Check to see if there's any null values on covered_entity_type
``` sql 
SELECT * 
FROM dbo.ReportTable 
WHERE covered_entity_type IS NULL; 
```
Checking to see if any of the names were inputted more than once to see if we can use existing data to populate the ones that are null 
``` sql 
SELECT 
	a.name_of_covered_entity, 
	a.covered_entity_type, 
	b.name_of_covered_entity, 
	b.covered_entity_type
FROM dbo.ReportTable AS a
JOIN dbo.ReportTable AS b 
	ON a.name_of_covered_entity = b.name_of_covered_entity
WHERE a.covered_entity_type IS NULL 
```
Populate the missing covered_entity_type with existing one 
``` sql 
UPDATE a
SET covered_entity_type = ISNULL(a.covered_entity_type, b.covered_entity_type) 
FROM dbo.ReportTable AS a
JOIN dbo.ReportTable AS b 
	ON a.name_of_covered_entity = b.name_of_covered_entity
WHERE a.covered_entity_type IS NULL 
```

SELECT * FROM dbo.ReportTable

## Findings 
*** 2015: The Year of the Healthcare Data Breach 
Data breach in 2015 reached an all time high of **113M** cases recorded amongst any other years in the United States. According to the (HIPPA Journal)[https://www.hipaajournal.com/2015-the-year-of-the-healthcare-data-breach-8239/], 2015 was the year when Cybercriminals and hackers broke through multiple US healthcare entities defence where they stole and exposed patients' health records. 
** Anthem, Inc.** led the TOP 10 covered entities that was hacked by contributing 46.6% to the grand total of 128M of these 10 covered entities. Which is why Healthcare plan was the highest type of entity to have this record. 
Granted, these years dates back where cyber defense, and malware identification has not yet improved. Most of these companies had outdated systems, and medical staff did not have proper security training or multi-factor authentication like we do now.
